Notes to self:
Move summary is handled in plugin for Gen 3 Contests, in Summary.rb

change the color of other crustang
replace the pkmn icons on the overview
make "FINISH" appear on screen when whistle blows
definite issue with not being able to use moves if spinout move is canceled by using another move
make game keep track of your personal best and give personal best prize when you beat it
make summary screen available when choosing crustang to rent (maybe go right to summary page with crustang moves then ask to confirm choice)

Add animation to overloading a racer
