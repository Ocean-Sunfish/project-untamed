Notes to self:
Move summary is handled in plugin for Gen 3 Contests, in Summary.rb


Alright, organizing my thoughts for AI:

When to use invincible:
Use if available and there's a hazard coming up or if someone is within range of them and charging their spin out move

When to use secondBoost:
AI uses secondBoost when possible

When to strafe:
Do not bother avoiding obstacles if invincible






To do:
throttle use of all AI moves with RNG
add AI for racer2 and racer3
Change boost button to spacebar


After events (polish):
Add part of the track that slow you down, and make AI bad at avoiding it or maybe not try to avoid (maybe with RNG rolls?)
Add animation to overloading a racer
Make shiny crustang opponents/rentables possible and make the overworld reflect shininess
