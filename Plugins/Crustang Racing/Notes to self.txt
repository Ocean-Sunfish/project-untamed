replace the pkmn icons on the overview
change the color of other crustang


give rewards based on your placement and how many laps you did
make the race cost money
make renting a crustang cost additonal fee
make summary screen available when choosing crustang to rent (maybe go right to summary page with crustang moves then ask to confirm choice)

Add animation to overloading a racer
